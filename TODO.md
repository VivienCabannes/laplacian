- Implement polynomial kernel.
- Implement a function that return Laplacian eigenvalues.
- Implement a clustering algorithm
- Implement diffusion distance \sum \lambda_i \|\phi_i(x) - \phi_i(y)\|.
- Find a set of problem that are solved with diffusion maps, and solve them with klap.


Real world validation:
- Unrolling the swiss role
- Sampling
- Solve MNIST with it
- Samples new digit with it?


- Compare the regularization on L or on R.
