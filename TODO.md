- Implement a clustering algorithm
- Find a set of problem that are solved with diffusion maps, and solve them with klap.
- Implement the method with a finite number of features.
- Implement graph-Laplacian


Real world validation:
- Unrolling the swiss role
- Sampling
- Solve MNIST with it
- Samples new digit with it?


- Compare the regularization on L or on R.
