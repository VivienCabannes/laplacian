- Implement the method with a finite number of features, notably for polynomials (could also be useful for random features).

- Implement a clustering algorithm.
- Find a set of problem that are solved with diffusion maps, and solve them with klap.

Real world validation:
- Unrolling the swiss role
- Solve MNIST with it
- Sampling: Samples new digit with it?

Experiments:
- Compare the regularization on L or on R.
