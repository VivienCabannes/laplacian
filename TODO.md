- Implement polynomial kernel.
- Transfer everything towards jax or pytorch (see if there is an implementation of GSVD).
- Implement diffusion distance \sum \lambda_i \|\phi_i(x) - \phi_i(y)\|.
- Implement some sort of grid search for hyperparameters.
- Find a set of problem that are solved with diffusion maps, and solve them with klap.
